        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used. </p>
        <p>Fried chicken has been described as being "crunchy" and "juicy",[24] as well as "crispy". The dish has also been called "spicy" and "salty".[26] Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste.[27] This is especially common in fast food restaurant chains such as KFC.[28] The dish is traditionally served with mashed potatoes, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn or biscuits.</p>
